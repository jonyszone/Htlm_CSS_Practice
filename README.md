**Divs And Spans:**

*Divs*

The *div* tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The *div* tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The *div* tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

Any sort of content can be put inside the *div* tag! 
 
 *Spans*
 
 The *span* tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The *span* tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

The *span* tag is much like the *div* element, but *div* is a block-level element and *span* is an inline element.
 
 **Forms:**
 
 The *form* element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.
 
 The HTML *form* element can contain one or more of the following form elements:

- input
- label
- select
- textarea
- button
- fieldset
- legend
- datalist
- output
- option
- optgroup
 
 **Forms usage in my projects**
